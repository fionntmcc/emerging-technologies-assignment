    "The [Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/modules/computer-science/deutsch-jozsa) is one of the earliest quantum algorithms, developed by David Deutsch and Richard Jozsa in 1992. It was designed to demonstrate a clear separation between quantum and classical computation, showing that quantum computers can solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm works with **Boolean functions** — functions that accept a fixed number of Boolean inputs (each either `True` or `False`) and return a single Boolean output. For a function with $n$ inputs, there are $2^n$ possible input combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key constraint is that each function must be one of two types:\n",
    "- **Constant**: The function returns the same value (`True` or `False`) for *all* possible input combinations\n",
    "- **Balanced**: The function returns `True` for *exactly half* of the input combinations and `False` for the other half\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem focuses on generating random functions that satisfy these constraints, which will later be used to compare classical and quantum approaches to determining the function type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea for this problem is to randomly generate either a constant value (`True` or `False`) for all possible combinations of n binary inputs, or return True (which are randomly distributed) for exactly half of the combinations (and False for the other half).\n",
    "\n",
    "For n inputs there will be $2^n$ outputs as there are $2^n$ combinations."

    "\n",
    "[Deutsch's algorithm](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/courses/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms/quantum-query-algorithms/deutsch-algorithm), developed by David Deutsch in 1985, was the first quantum algorithm to demonstrate a [potential advantage of quantum computing](https://www.quantamagazine.org/john-preskill-explains-quantum-supremacy-20191002/) over classical computation. It addresses a question: given a black-box function (oracle), can we determine a global property of that function more efficiently using quantum mechanics?\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is framed as follows: we are given a function $f: \\{0, 1\\}^n \\rightarrow \\{0, 1\\}$ that is promised to be either **constant** or **balanced**. Our task is to determine which type it is by querying (calling) the function as few times as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classical Limitation**: Classically, in the worst case, we must query the function at least $2^{n-1} + 1$ times to be certain of the answer. This is because a balanced function could match a constant function's output for up to half of all inputs before revealing a different value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quantum Advantage**: Deutsch's algorithm (and its generalisation, the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm) can determine the function type with just **one** query, regardless of the number of inputs. This exponential speedup, while on a contrived problem, was historically significant as proof that quantum computers could outperform classical ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before exploring the quantum solution, we must first understand the classical approach and its limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem requires writing a function called `determine_constant_balanced`, which takes a parameter `f` (the function written in Problem 1). `f` is the truth table returned from the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "`determine_constant_balanced` returns whether the function is `constant` or `balanced` based on the black box output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since constant can either return True or False for every index in the truth table, we can take the initial value and save it in a variable `first_value`. We then loop through each index and if any index does not equal `first_value`, then the function must be `balanced`. If the first `len(f) // 2 + 1` indices of the truth table `f` all equal `first_value`, then the function is guaranteed to be constant, as more than half of the truth table is equal to `first_value`. Note that `len(f) // 2 + 1` can be expressed as $2^{n-1} + 1$ where $n$ is the `num_inputs`."
