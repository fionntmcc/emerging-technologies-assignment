    "The [Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/modules/computer-science/deutsch-jozsa) is one of the earliest quantum algorithms, developed by David Deutsch and Richard Jozsa in 1992. It was designed to demonstrate a clear separation between quantum and classical computation, showing that quantum computers can solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm works with **Boolean functions** — functions that accept a fixed number of Boolean inputs (each either `True` or `False`) and return a single Boolean output. For a function with $n$ inputs, there are $2^n$ possible input combinations.\n",

    "The key constraint is that each function must be one of two types:\n",

    "[Deutsch's algorithm](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/courses/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms/quantum-query-algorithms/deutsch-algorithm), developed by David Deutsch in 1985, was the first quantum algorithm to demonstrate a [potential advantage of quantum computing](https://www.quantamagazine.org/john-preskill-explains-quantum-supremacy-20191002/) over classical computation. It addresses a question: given a black-box function (oracle), can we determine a global property of that function more efficiently using quantum mechanics?\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is framed as follows: we are given a function $f: \\{0, 1\\}^n \\rightarrow \\{0, 1\\}$ that is promised to be either **constant** or **balanced**. Our task is to determine which type it is by querying (calling) the function as few times as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classical Limitation**: Classically, in the worst case, we must query the function at least $2^{n-1} + 1$ times to be certain of the answer. This is because a balanced function could match a constant function's output for up to half of all inputs before revealing a different value.\n",

    "**Quantum Advantage**: Deutsch's algorithm (and its generalisation, the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm) can determine the function type with just **one** query, regardless of the number of inputs.

    "`determine_constant_balanced` returns whether the function is `constant` or `balanced` based on the black box output.\n",

We then loop through each index and if any index does not equal `first_value`, then the function must be `balanced`. If the first `len(f) // 2 + 1` indices of the truth table `f` all equal `first_value`, then the function is guaranteed to be constant, as more than half of the truth table is equal to `first_value`. Note that `len(f) // 2 + 1` can be expressed as $2^{n-1} + 1$ where $n$ is the `num_inputs`."
